This Voice Assistant mini project is a simple yet powerful implementation of a voice-activated assistant using natural language processing and speech recognition technologies. The purpose of this project is to provide users with a hands-free and convenient way to interact with their devices by issuing voice commands.

Features
Speech Recognition: The assistant can accurately transcribe spoken words into text, enabling seamless interaction through voice commands.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): The assistant employs NLP techniques to understand and interpret user input, allowing for more natural and context-aware conversations.

Command Execution: Execute various commands using voice input, such as opening applications, searching the web, setting reminders, and more.

Customizable Responses: Tailor the responses and interactions of the voice assistant to suit your preferences, making it a personalized and enjoyable experience.
